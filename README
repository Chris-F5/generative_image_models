ADVERSARIAL MODELS
------------------

GAN
    Goodfellow 2014 Generative Adversarial Networks
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661
    Implemented this and ran on MNIST digits. Worked alright but output images
    were a bit noisy.

DCGAN
    Radford 2016 Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434
    Implemented this and ran on MNIST digits. Rsults better than GAN. When I
    naievly tried to scale up the input tensor for generative CNN, the output
    image did not look like a proper texture.

SGAN
    Jetchev 2017 Texture Synthesis with Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08207
    This is a simple extension of Radford 2016 [2] that enables us to scale
    up the generated image to abitrary size. This is essential for texture
    generation.


DIFFUSION MODELS
----------------

DDPM
    Ho 2020 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239
    I havent fully implemented this.
